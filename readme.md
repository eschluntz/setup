# Setup Scripts

One step setup for a new computer, VM, or server. This covers:

- Basic installs like git, python, vim
- Libraries like the scipy stack, and many useful pip libraries
- Full ROS install
- Clones some common repos
- Settings, like bash_aliases, vimrc, authorized_keys

## Things to Change before using

1. Your name and email for git
2. Your email for ssh
3. Which repos get cloned by default
4. Your authorized_keys, unless you want me to give me access as well ;)

## Usage

1. Clone / Fork and modify for your system
2. SCP folder to new machine
3. `bash setup.sh` and follow prompts
